# Javascript_Capstone_Todoist

Setting up the REST API

The capstone project is supported by a Node.js REST API that you can clone from:

git clone https://github.com/DevelopIntelligenceBoulder/stay-organized-workshop-express-server
After you clone this repository to your local computer, change directories (cd) into the newly cloned project folder and Install the projects dependencies with NPM 
cd stay-organized-workshop-express-server  
npm install
Start the local server using the command:
npm start
Expected Output
  App listening at port 8083
You can verify the server is working as expected by using a browser to access http://localhost:8083/api/users

EST API Endpoints
The supported endpoints are shown below.  Please note you will need to prepend them with http://localhost:8083/ before sending the request to the API

The site already has some users registered.  You can see them by looking at the server's data/users.json file.  It resembles:

[
  {
    "id":1,
    "name": "Ian Auston", 
    "username": "gamer04", 
    "password": "gamer04!"
  },
  ...
]
